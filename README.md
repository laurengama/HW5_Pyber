There appears to be an inverse relationship between total number of rides and average fare. Cities with higher numbers of rides tend to have lower fares, while fewer rides are associated with higher fares. Urban cities have the most rides (68.4%), while suburban (26.3%) and rural (5.3%) cities have far fewer rides. This could perhaps be because in rural and suburban areas more people tend to have cars, lowering the demand for ride sharing, and distances to destinations tend to be longer, both of which could drive up fares. On the other hand, in urban areas fewer people typically own cars and destinations tend to be closer together, thereby lowering costs. The competitiveness of the ride sharing market in urban cities is demonstrated by the large proportion of drivers in urban cities (80.9%) compared to suburban (16.5%) or rural (2.6%) cities. And although urban fares tend to be lower than suburban or rural fares, they make up the majority of total fares (62.7%).
